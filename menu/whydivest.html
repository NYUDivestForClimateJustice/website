		<h1> why divestment? </h1><br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Climate change is already loading the dice for extreme weather events like Hurricane Sandy, which not only battered communities but cost New York City almost $50 billion. Now, recent reports show that the fossil fuel industry has five times more carbon in their reserves than scientists say we can burn and still keep warming below 2&deg;C, a target that every country on earth has agreed to. Fossil fuel divestment is a clear way for NYU to live up to its values and help society address this crisis.</li><br>
			<li>Divestment is the opposite of investment &ndash; it simply means getting rid of stocks, bonds or investment funds that are unethical or morally ambiguous. The message is simple: if it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage.</li><br>
			<li>A fossil fuel divestment movement will help take away the social license of the fossil fuel industry, weakening their political power. Just think: if hundreds of campuses divested, it would start an important discussion in the market about the long-term viability of fossil fuels and the need to transition to clean energy economy.</li><br>
			<li>It&#39;s great to see NYU greening the campus, but we need our university to green its portfolio as well. In fact, it&#39;s entirely inconsistent for the university to reduce emissions on campus only to invest in companies that are increasing emissions around the world. NYU shouldn&#39;t be investing in an industry that is destroying the planet that students are inheriting.</li><br>
			<li>The bottom line is that divestment is the only moral choice for institutions that care about the economy, society, and planet their students are going to inherit. Just the presence of student groups advocating for divestment will send ripples through the industry; as schools begin to actually divest, it will send shockwaves.</li>
